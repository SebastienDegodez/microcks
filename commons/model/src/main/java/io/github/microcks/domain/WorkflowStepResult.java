 * A step of a run. Its index is its place in the execution order of the run, given by the minion when it starts the

 * @param stepId      The id of the step in the workflow
 * @param operation   The operation the step called
 * @param status      How the step ended

 * @param elapsedTime How long the step took, in milliseconds
 * @param criteria    Its success criteria, as evaluated
 * @param outputs     Its outputs, by name
 * @param testCaseId  The id the request and response of the step are stored under; null when it sent none
