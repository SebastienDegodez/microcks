/**
 * What a step of an Arazzo workflow does when it succeeds or fails: retry the step, or end the workflow. The first

 * @param name       The name of the action
 * @param type       {@value #RETRY} or {@value #END}
 * @param retryAfter How long to wait before calling the step again, in seconds: 0 when the document gives none; null
 *                   for an action that does not retry
 * @param retryLimit How many times the step may be called again: 1 when the document gives none, as Arazzo says; null
 *                   for an action that does not retry
 * @param criteria   The criteria that must hold for the action to apply, in the order of the document; empty when it
 *                   always applies
